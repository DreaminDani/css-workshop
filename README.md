# CSS-Workshop
Based on the following designs: https://www.figma.com/file/BYWiTZtDqeletaz3wAPjtH/Design-Workshop?node-id=1%3A7423

Each branch refers to a step in the workshop.

## Notes on what I did in each step go here
### Baseline
Took ~30 minutes.

Used [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) to auto-reload CSS and HTML.

Intentionally used css and html (since SCSS didn't seem necessary yet).

Intentionally used `float: right` and a fixed width for the list... since the spec didn't call for it being responsive. Should we discuss this tradeoff?
